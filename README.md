ThriftLab - Vintage Streetwear E-Commerce Web Application

1. Project Description
ThriftLab is a responsive web application prototype designed for a modern thrift store specializing in curated vintage streetwear. The project demonstrates advanced web design principles, including responsive layouts, interactive content management, and data visualization.

The application serves as both a customer-facing storefront and an administrative dashboard. It features a seamless user experience across devices, from browsing products to managing sales data. The design aesthetic reflects the "Built From The Streets" brand identity, utilizing a minimalist, urban color palette and typography.
